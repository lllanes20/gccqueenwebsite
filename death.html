		 <h2> Freddy Mercury's Death</h2>
		 <section id="rightColumn">
         <p>On November 24, 1991, an announcement had shocked the world of the infamous
		 leader and singer, Freddie Mercury and his sudden death. Previously a day before his death, Freddie had
		 publicly announced and revealed of his diagnosis of Aids but eventually succumbed to the complications
		 of it. Specifically, his cause of death was bronchial pneumonia. Freddie died at the age of 45 and would have
		 been 76 of this year [2022].</p>
		 <br></br>
		 <p> Freddie was known for having a secretive and personal life. He was diagnosed with Aids as of 
		 1987 and even his own band members didn't expect one of their own to have it. Aids/HIV is a serious virus that attacks
		 the human's immune system and can be transmitted with direct contact, sexually, or through drug use. Till today, there
		 is no cure for Aids but can only be taken through medication to keep your immune system healthy and hopefully extend your life.
		 Since Freddie's diagnosis, he fought not only for his life but also for people who were also diagnosed with the disease. 
		 
		 <h3> Freddy Mercury's Tribute Concert </h3>
		<p>After the death of Freddie Mercury, the members, Brian, Roger, and John decided to host and perform
		a tribute concert in honor of Freddie. The tribute concert was known as <b>The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert
		for Aids Awareness</b>. It was performed on April 20, 1992 at the Wembley Stadium with high-profile star guests, such as <b>
		Guns n Roses, Metallica, Elton John, Liza Minnelli, and George Michael</b> performed in honor of the deceased star of Queen. Over 72,000 tickets
		were sold out and star performers played their songs but also Queen's songs as well.</p>
