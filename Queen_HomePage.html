		 <h2> Who is Queen?</h2>
		 <section id="rightColumn">
         <p>Originated in London, England, Queen is a british rock band composed of the members Brian May, 
		 Roger Taylor, John Deacon, and Freddie Mercury. This band rose into fame in the 1970s and is known for popular songs 
		 such as <b>"We are the Champions", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Don't Stop Me Now", "Another One Bites the Dust"</b>, and much more. 
		 Their music style falls into the rock genre but are influenced by many alternative styles of rock such
		 as heavy metal, operatic rock, and progressive rock, for example. As of today, since the death of
		 Freddy Mercury and the retirement of John Deacon, Queen became a two-member band with alternate spinoffs with other singers
		 and continues to perform till this day.</p>
		 <br></br>
		 <h3> Background </h3>
		<p>Before the band was 'Queen', the band was previously known as <b>"Smile"</b>. Brian and Roger where the original memebrs 
		of this band, along with Tim Staffel who was the original vocalist at that time. The band was active from 1968 till 1970. Freddy Mercury came into the picture when Tim and Freddie
		were attending the same art college together in which Freddie was inspired by 'Smile' into composing his own music. Eventually, 
		Tim Staffell left the band in 1970, and Freddy Mercury was dedicated in joining the band. He convinced the two members left of 
		the band to continue. At that same year, Freddy eventually joined the band as a vocalist and turns 'Smile' into the infamous band, 
		'Queen'. John Deacon was eventually recruited in 1971 to complete the lineup as a bass player.</p>
		<br></br>
		<h3> Why the name Queen? </h3>
		<p>Since Freddy Mercury's recruitment, he changed Smile's band name to <b>Queen</b>. According to American Song Writer, Freddy explains
		about this bold name choice in an interview because Queen was <b>"strong", "universal"</b>, and <b>"immediate"</b>. The name reflected
		not only the singer himself but also to help visualize the band's skill and style. Specifically, he wanted their band to be envisioned as very complicated
		and striking in which Freddy does bid to his word of how amazing and extravagent Queen has truly become throughout their active years.
